DESCRIPTION:

This program uses shaders to implement the Phong Model for illumination by using Specular,Diffuse and Ambient lighting techniques.
There are two heros Bith and SkipShowers who are both playable in the map. There is a freecam, individual First Person cams, and individual arcBall cams.
The program implements past lab material and assignment into our group project using shader files to send attributes to the GPU.

USAGE:

W - moves hero forward (based on direction the hero is facing)
S - moves hero backward
A - turns hero to the left
D - turns hero to the right

1 is arcball cam
2 is free cam
3 is First Person cam
4 switches to Bith (Vehicle)
5 switches to SkipShowers

q ends program

Space - Zooms in the arcball camera
Space + Shift - Zooms out the arcball camera
Left mouse click and drag - Allows user to move the arcball camera around the hero

COMPILING:

The code should compile using a proper CMakeLists.txt file, I don't think there should be any problems there

Bugs:
No known bugs.

Responsibilities:

Brendan:
Added Bith to starter code and worked on getting Bith to work with Grant's A3.
Changed Bith functions to make it streamlined and work well together.
Fixed bugs
Implemented ambient and specular lighting in shader file.
Added trees

Grant:
Starter code from his A3
Created camera swap variables and implemented them in starter code.
Set up freecam
Implemented spot light and point light
Fixed bugs

TIME SPENT:
~10 hours

LAB HELP:
8 Previous labs helped a lot with this assignment. We would have no clue where to start otherwise. Using A3 as a start point
helped a lot on this assignment.

Fun: 8 This lab was fun there was just a lot of assignments due when it was assigned.

NOTE:
Bith 1st person is on top of the vehicle.
